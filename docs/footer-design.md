# CloudFi Labs - Footer Design Documentation

> Documentation for the footer component design and implementation

## üìã Overview

This document provides detailed information about the footer component design and implementation in the CloudFi Labs application. The footer has been designed to provide essential navigation and information while maintaining a clean, responsive layout.

## üé® Design Approach

### Layout Structure
The footer implements a responsive 2-column layout:
- **Left Column**: Company information, social media links, and contact details
- **Right Column**: Navigation links organized in a 2x2 grid (Products, Solutions, Resources, Legal, Company)

This approach differs from the original design specification which called for a comprehensive 4-5 column layout. The 2-column design was chosen to:
1. Improve readability on all device sizes
2. Reduce visual complexity
3. Maintain better focus on key navigation elements
4. Ensure consistent spacing and alignment

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile**: Stacked single column layout with clear section headings
- **Tablet**: 2-column layout with balanced content distribution
- **Desktop**: 2-column layout with optimized spacing

## üß© Component Structure

### Company Information Section
Located in the left column, this section includes:
- Company logo and name
- Brief company description
- Social media links with proper security attributes
- Contact information (address, phone, email)

### Navigation Links
Located in the right column, organized in a 2x2 grid:
- **Left Sub-column**: 
  - Products links
  - Solutions links
  - Company links
- **Right Sub-column**: 
  - Resources links
  - Legal links

### Newsletter Signup
